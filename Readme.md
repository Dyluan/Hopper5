# MORNING

#### What will I do in the morning?

Wake up, take a shower, have a continental breakfast, run as fast as I can to not be late at beCode and then start my day by writing some code!

# AFTERNOON

### What will I do in the afternoon?

In the afternoon, I'll probably get less productive because I'll be tired from eating and as soon as beCode ends, I'll rush home to make myself dinner.

# EVENING

### What will I do in the evening?

Usually, I don't do much in the evening. I help my gf with whatever she wants help with, then we make dinner, and then I either watch a serie with her or I play video games with some friends until late in the night. After that, I go to bed way too late and calculate how much sleeping time I'll get, while shaking my head in disbelief.

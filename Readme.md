# MORNING

#### What will I do in the morning?

Wake up, take a shower, have a continental breakfast, run as fast as I can to not be late at beCode and then start my day by writing some code!

# AFTERNOON

### What will I do in the afternoon?

In the afternoon, I'll probably get less productive because I'll be tired from eating and as soon as beCode ends, I'll rush home to make myself dinner.
